        <p>I'm a big artist and am taking Art in school and I'm creative and I love to figure out a problem. I also love disney especially the villians. I have dozens of sketchbooks full of everything from animals to superheroes. I live on a small croft without any animals but we are hoping to get a dog soon. I've always dreamed of owning a horse. I’m good at cooking and improvising in the kitchen. My mum says I can make a meal out of
            anything, which I guess is kind of true. I’m a vegetarian and I love any kind of pasta. I love taking apart
            things and putting them back together even if they don’t always work the first time. I did a course in
            engineering last year which I loved. I love reading and have shelves of books. I’m quite clumsy and not
            the best at talking to people, even people I’ve known for ages.</p>

        <p>
            My Dad prides himself with his garden, my Mum is a carer and spends most of her time at work. I have
            two brothers. The eldest is a butcher and he loves music and basketball. My younger brother is obsessed
            with video games and doesn’t do much else. </p>

        <p>I’d like to learn everything I possibly can about anything to do with coding, computers and
            programming. Everything to do with Computer Science interests me to the extent that my family have
            no idea what I’m talking about half the time. I was thinking of going into video game development, but
            my dream job would be either robotics or designing new tech to improve the world and help people.
            Personally, my music taste is not amazing, I don’t really like stuff like rap or hard rock. I tend to listen to
            the top charts a lot and a little bit of punk or I listen to a lot of original music on YouTube. My favourite
            artist now would be Hailee Steinfeld or Imagine Dragons and Panic at the Disco.
            As of June 2020, my hair is bright blue and has been a whole rainbow of colors. I dye it myself and I'm
            getting pretty good at it. I have now gone back to my natural colour. I’m good at school and I love learning. There’s not much more I can say about
            myself.   </p>
